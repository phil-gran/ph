                        <li>When rescheduling, before setting up an appointment for the rescheduling, try to ask the questions to check student's eligibility. This is to help us all save time. At least we will know if students are eligible or not.</li>

                        <li>Leave notes in the CRM as well of their eligibility. So that people assigned in the rescheduling won't be asking the same questions to students</li>

                    <h2>Important Note:</h2>
                    <img src="image/think.jpg" alt="image" width="350px" style="border-radius: 50px;">
                    <p>&nbsp;If the lead/student hung up the phone on the first call/dial, then you need to try calling one more time. If the call's routed to voicemail, then change the status to CANCELED. Leave a note in the CRM the reason it's canceled.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;ALWAYS  check session assignment sheet for available ACs. Compare with the posts on slack to see if the status was updated or not.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;Calling team, you are the ones who will change the status in the CRM from BOOKED, RECHEDULING, NO PICKUP to "ON-GOING" in the CRM. Do not forget to click the name of the assigned sales.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;No need to call back students that have successfully joined the session. You are only allowed for a call back if the student is not yet in the Zoom. ACs have their iplums, so no need for you to call them back when they have joined the Zoom meeting. Unless student is not yet in the Zoom, then you should call the student.</p>

                    <p> &nbsp;How to know if students joined? See the reaction of the ACs on your post.</p>

                    <p><p>&nbsp;Do not ask if students are available, do everything to make them take it now or later.</p>
