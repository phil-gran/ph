                <h4>OPENING SPIEL:</h4>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, this is (caller) from TECH IS, the online coding boot camp. Am I speaking with <b>(student's name)</b>?</p><br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, <b>(student's name)</b>. I am calling to invite you to a Zoom meeting with the academic counselor. Will you please join? The interview session will be in the Zoom. The Zoom link will be sent within 5 minutes. Please stay on the line, do not end the call yet.</p><br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, while waiting for the Zoom link, I need to confirm a few things from you. </p>
                
                <h4>First, do you have a laptop? a desktop?</h4>
                
                <h4>Are you a US citizen?</h4>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">NOT,</span> Are you a green card holder (permanent resident)?</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">YES</span> to Green Card or permanent resident, Do you have a Social Security Number?</p>
 
                <h4>If you don't mind me asking, how old are you?</h4>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(if over 40) Do you have IT-related job experience? (software related)</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No experience, no session = over 40</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below 18 and above 40, tag lead as Not Eligible</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check age requirement on the left side of the screen</p>

                <h4>Lastly, what's your highest educational attainment?</h4>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Once student is eligible, copy the name of the student from the CRM, paste it on slack, then assign it to the academic counselor.)</p>
                <br>
                <p><em>Note: While assigning on slack, talk to the student. Say " I assigned you to (name of the academic counselor). She/He will send it to you within a minute. Please give us a few moments. Do not end the call yet. I will assist you until you meet the academic counselor in the Zoom."</em></p>

                <h4>By the way, while waiting, let me check if this is your email address. Is it (student's email)?</h4><br>
                <p>I just got the zoom link from (academic counselor's name), kindly check your inbox now.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">NOT,</span> say <i>" You still did not receive an email from (AC's name)? Please check your spam messages."</i></p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">YES</span> Is it from (Academic Counselor's Name? Perfect!</p>
                
                <h4>What device are you going to use for the Zoom meeting?</h4>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>If the student's going to use the phone because he/she is not in front of a computer or they are outside.</i></p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since you're going to use your phone, we need to end the call 1st before you click and join the zoom meeting for the audio to work.</p>

                <h4>One last check, do you have <b>ZOOM</b> installed in your phone?</h4>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. We need to end the call now. Bye. Have a great day!</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>If student is going to use a laptop/desktop computer, assist them until the student meets the academic counselor</i> </p>
